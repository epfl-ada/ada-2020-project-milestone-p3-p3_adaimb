1. Title: Predicting the present with google trends

2. Abstract : the authors of the paper present several examples to support their theory. We would like to add some figures to the existing paper. The first figure we would want to add is the representation of the trend model vs base model vs actual data for the initial claims for unemployment benefits (figure 2 in the paper but for the initial claims for unemployment benefits). The second figure we would like to add would be the same kind of figure for the same dataset (initial claims) but for another time series (for example 2011 to 2020). Those figures would allow us to further check the accuracy of the trend model and would support or not the theory of the authors. Furthermore, we wanted to apply the Google trend forecasting method to another dataset. One which came to our mind is the number of births per months in the US.  Indeed, it is common knowledge now that birth rates have come to be considered as one of the (multiple) indicators of the general well-being of societies. We will support our study papers two existing papers and we will collect monthly data on the Internet. We will then apply the trend model to this dataset just as the authors of the paper did with the other datasets, i.e by a simple linear regression. 


3. Research questions : 
Is the model consistent with other topics and/or other time series ?
Does the model improve the prediction over the base model for the initial claims data ?
Does a drop in fertility follows the recession of 2008?
In general when did fertility increased or dropped specifically ? 

4. Proposed datasets :
